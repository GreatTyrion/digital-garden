# What You Can Learn from the Cerulean Service by SkyTruth

The **Cerulean** service by SkyTruth is a global, free, public online map and data platform that uses satellite technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor and combat **ocean oil pollution**.

By using this service, you can learn the following:

---

## ðŸŒŠ Monitoring and Tracking Oil Pollution

* **Oil Slick Detection:** You can view the location and scope of potential **marine oil pollution incidents** (oil slicks) detected automatically and in near real-time from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 radar satellite imagery.
* **Identification of Sources:** The system automatically identifies the **likely sources** of the pollution, primarily **shipping vessels** and **offshore oil and gas platforms**, using machine learning models and data like the Automatic Identification System (AIS).
* **Vessel Accountability:** The platform often provides a "Source Profile" which connects specific vessel behavior (such as location histories or events where AIS was turned off) with possible pollution events, strengthening the path from detection to **accountability**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Understanding Pollution Trends

* **Chronic Pollution Patterns:** Cerulean helps to reveal and track **chronic oil pollution** from activities like illegal bilge dumping by ships or the routine discharge of "produced water" from oil rigs. This provides a broader, more accurate picture of pollution than officially reported statistics.
* **Global Hotspots:** Users can identify global and regional **hotspots** for vessel and infrastructure oil slicks, allowing conservationists, journalists, and enforcement agencies to focus their efforts where the problem is most pervasive.

The service is designed to empower ocean advocates and organizations with the scientific data needed to investigate pollution, track potential culprits, and drive policy changes to protect marine ecosystems and coastal communities.
