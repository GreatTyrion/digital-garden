# 🌱 My Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden. This is a space where I cultivate ideas, share creations, and document my learning journey. Unlike a traditional blog, this garden is organized into "issues"—self-contained Markdown documents where each might contain maps, stories, knowledge, tools, and various curiosities I've been tending to.

## What's a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is an online space for thinking in public. It's less about polished final products and more about the process of growth. Here, you'll find a collection of notes, essays, projects, and half-baked ideas that I'm currently tending to.

## 🌳 Explore the Garden

Each "issue" in this garden is a unique collection that may include:

* **🗺️ Maps & Visualizations:** Personal cartography projects and data visualizations.
* **📖 Writing & Fiction:** Short stories, novel excerpts, and narrative experiments.
* **🧠 Knowledge Snippets:** Interesting concepts, research notes, and things I'm learning about.
* **🛠️ Toolbox:** Cool tools, software, and resources I find useful.
* **💭 Seedlings:** Raw, unpolished thoughts and early-stage ideas.

Browse the issues below to see what's currently growing.

## 📬 Latest Issues

| Issue | Date | Description | Contains |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| [#1](posts/issue-1/issue-1.md) | 2025-09-28 | Something I want to share. | 🗺️, 🧠, 🛠️, 📖 |

*(I'll maintain this table as new issues are published.)*

## How This Garden Grows

* **Issue-Based:** Content is published in individual Markdown files, each containing a mix of different elements.
* **No Schedule:** New issues appear whenever I have enough interesting material to share. There is no fixed publishing schedule.
* **Work in Progress:** Notes may be incomplete, revised, or linked to other notes as my understanding evolves.
* **Connection over Chronology:** The value is in how ideas connect, not in when they were posted.
